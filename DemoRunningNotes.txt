Applications for demo:
----------------------
a) EDDRE:
      Code: https://github.nfcu.net/deploy-mgmt-test-org/test-EDDRE/blob/main/Jenkinspipeline
      Jenkins pipeline: https://slvdcrvcbjmas03.nfcu.net:8443/job/DeployMgmt/job/deploy-mgmt-test-org/job/test-EDDRI/job/main/
	  
b) NICL:
      Code: https://github.nfcu.net/deploy-mgmt-test-org/test-NICL/blob/main/Jenkinspipeline
	  
b) EDDRI:
	  Code: https://github.nfcu.net/deploy-mgmt-test-org/test-EDDRI/blob/main/Jenkinspipeline
      Jenkins pipeline: https://slvdcrvcbjmas03.nfcu.net:8443/job/DeployMgmt/job/deploy-mgmt-test-org/job/test-EDDRI/job/main/

Test Usecases
-------------
1) Application NOT part of Piloting - Positive testcase
   ENABLE_BUILD_BLOCKING="" OR flag missing in Jenkinspipeline

   Expected Result: Build should go without blocking/failing even in there are vulnerabilities
   
2) Application is part of Piloting - Enable Build Blocking
    ENABLE_BUILDBLOCKING ="true" (non-empty string)
	ENABLE_BUILD_BLOCKING="false"
	ENABLE_BUILD_BLOCKING="anything"
 
    a) Exists vulnerabilities, and build should fail - Positive testcase
	   Thresholds default to:
	      LOW_THRESHOLD=9999
		  MED_THRESHOLD=8
		  HIGH_THRESHOLD=0

3) Exception (Marcus will mark the few vulnerabilities in CheckMarx portal as Exception)

4) FalsePositive (Marcus will mark the few vulnerabilities in CheckMarx portal as Exception)
 
 
Questions to security team:
---------------------------
1) The cutoff date/baseline date for CheckMarx scanning 
   Hardcoded to "28 Nov 2023 06:00:00 GMT"
   
2) What thresholds should we use for piloting and production?
   	highThreshold_default = 0
	mediumThreshold_default = 8
	lowThreshold_default = 9999
	
3) Need definitions of StateId codes (StateId value, and description) & Severity levels for documentation and better code readability
      + Currently we mark as a net-new vulnerability if (stateId !=5 and stateId != 1) and Severity != 'Low' of a finding.
	  
4) Should the piloting projects be added to CheckMarx and BlackDuck?

5) What is enforcement date for all projects across the enterprise?

6) What is date for piloting? Does 3 applications suffice for piloting?

7) Can BlackDuck and CheckMarx scan zip and archive (.ear/.war) files? 
    For ex: ++ DataPower applications ( https://github.nfcu.net/NFCU-DataPower/PPUDP/tree/master/PPUDP ) 
        	++ Websphere applications prebuilt .war, .ear files that won't get built in our tool. For ex: (https://github.nfcu.net/NFCU/ardsRTDaemonGUI/blob/main/assembly/build.xml)

8) Will there be a grace period before enforcement enterprise wide?


POC Applications
================
  + BGL (pipelineAntDa)
  + ARIC_PAYMENT_JAVA (pipelineJavaUcd)
  + CMED / CMDU (pipelineAntDa) - Tentative
  
+ Believe we will use real repos and involve development team during piloting. Is it right?
